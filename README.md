# ZWSUC

(CURRENTLY ONLY SUPPORTS x64 MACHNINES)
Extremely simple program to check if a phrase has a Zero Width Space (U+200) problem. The issue usually occurs in Java code but the checker is made out of C++ to check if accounts have the Zero Width Space issue. 

-Do not improt raw java code into this program if you think your java code has the ZWSUC problem.
This program was desgin to check small phrases.

-Currently it only detects one unicode at a time. Ill probably soon change this if I feel like it.


-HOW TO USE-

+ Just put in a phrase as user input lol
